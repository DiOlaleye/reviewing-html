    <h3>Stephen Curry</h3>
    <p>Stephen Curry is widely regarded as one of the greatest players in NBA history. 
      He has revolutionized the game with his incredible shooting range and ability to make shots from virtually 
      anywhere on the court. Curry has won multiple MVP awards and has led the Warriors to several NBA championships. 
    He is currently heading into his 17th NBA season as he looks to lead the Warriors to another championship.</p>

    <h3>Jimmy Butler III</h3>
    <p>Butler was aquired on February 6, 2025 as part of a 5 team deal that agreed to send Butler to the Golden State Warriors. 
      He is an excellent 2-way player and is a master of getting to the free throw line. With him and Draymond Green in the frontcourt,
    this Golden State defense is scary. He is an excellent leader, and he's a playmaker for when Curry goes to the bench.</p>
    <h4>Things he needs to work on</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Shot taking: Last season he had a tendancy of not looking at the rim and passing up a wide open shot</li>
      <li> 3 point shooting: I would like to see him shoot upwards of 34% from 3 this season</li> 
    </ul>

    <h3>Draymond Green</h3>
    <p>Draymond Green is known for his versatility, defensive prowess, and leadership. He is regarded as one of the best
      defensive players of all time, and he has been crucial in helping the Warriors secure multiple championships.
      Green's ability to guard multiple positions and facilitate the offense makes him an invaluable asset to the team. The secondary leader
    of the Warriors, Draymond has an immense amount of energy that can't be replicated.</p>
      <h4>Things he needs to work on</h4>
      <ul>
        <li> Agression: Draymond has been known to have a short temper, which has led to a lot of ejections and technical fouls. I would like to see it kept to a minimum: Below 10 technicals this year</li>
        </ul>

      <h3>Brandin Podziemski</h3>
      <p> Entering his 3rd NBA season, Podziemski has already established himself as a secondary playmaker beside Steph Curry.
        The 22 year old is a reliable shooter and playmaker, and he's a solid defender, a role which the Warriors value greatly.
        His prescence has allowed Steph Curry to play off ball more often, which becamea strenght of their offense in the 2024-2025 season.
        Overall, Podziemski is a rising star in the league and could become an All-NBA player in the near future. He has all the tools to do it, but consistensy is a real issue for him at the moment. </p>
        <h4>Things he needs to work on</h4>
        <ul>
          <li> Ball Handling: As a guard, he needs to improve his ball handling skills to reduce turnovers and create more scoring opportunities for himself and his teammates.</li>
          <li> Shot selection: His shot selection last year was questionable at best. I would love to see his efficiency improve this season</li>
          <li> Consistensy: There would be nights that he would go off for like 20 points, but then the next game he would just completely disappear. He needs to string strong games together to solidify his spot in the rotation</li>
        </ul>

      <h4>Things he needs to work on</h4>
      <ul>
        <li> Playmaking: As a wing player, improving his ability to create scoring opportunities for his teammates will enhance his overall impact on the game.</li>
        <li> Consistency: Finding ways to maintain a high level of performance throughout the season will be crucial for his development.</li>
        <li> Defense: He's already a good defender, but Warriors fans would love to see him become one of the NBA's best defenders. Some Mentorship from Draymond Green could help that</li>
