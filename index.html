    <h3>Jimmy Butler III</h3>

    this Golden State defense is scary</p>

      <li>6 time All Star</li>
      <li>5 time All NBA selection</li>

      <h3>Brandin Podziemski</h3>
      <p> Entering his 3rd NBA season, Podziemski has already established himself as a secondary playmaker beside Steph Curry.
        The 22 year old is a reliable shooter and playmaker, and he's a solid defender, a role which the Warriors value greatly.
        His prescence has allowed Steph Curry to play off ball more often, which becamea strenght of their offense in the 2024-2025 season.
        Overall, Podziemski is a rising star in the league and could become an All-NBA player in the near future. </p>
      <h4>Accomplishments</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>NBA All-Rookie First Team (2024)</li>
        <li> 2 Rising Stars selections</li>
